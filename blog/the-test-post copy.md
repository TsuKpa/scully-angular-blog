# The Test Post

**This guide was most recently updated on Wed, June 3rd, 2020 to be compatible with Next 9.4+.**

What’s Next? Well, it’s not in the past, amirite? Ha! Ha ha! Okay but for real, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a framework for building React applications, and you can bet your bottom that you can make great [Jamstack applications](https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/) on Netlify with it! Next has become rather popular because of its file-based routing, how easy it is to get started, and how flexible it is. In fact, it’s so flexible that there aren't many “rules” in place for how you want to implement your projects and sites. That being said, here’s how to build a Markdown blog with the latest Next (9.4.4, at the time of writing), and how to deploy it to Netlify.

If you’d like to skip all of the jabber and just go straight to deploying, go ahead and [check out the repo for this project](https://github.com/cassidoo/next-netlify-blog-starter). It’s got a nice **[Deploy to Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/cassidoo/next-netlify-blog-starter&utm_source=github&utm_medium=blogstarter-cs&utm_campaign=devex)** button that’ll do all of the hard work for you, and you can get right to customizing it to your heart’s content!

Heads up, this tutorial assumes you know React, JavaScript, and CSS. If you need help on any of those fronts, feel free to ask questions in the [Netlify Community](https://community.netlify.com/)!

{{< toc >}}

## Setting up our Next.js project

When you want to start a new Next app, open up your terminal and run:

```shell
npm init next-app
```

You’ll be prompted for your project name, as well as a starting template. Go ahead and pick the “Default starter app” for this one.

Now, navigate inside your project, and add a `siteconfig.json` at the top level. Fill it in with a title and description, here’s what mine looks like:

```json
{
  "title": "Demo Blog",
  "description": "This is a simple blog built with Next, easily deployable to Netlify!"
}
```

Luckily Next doesn't add too much bloat to their starter, and the only directory that exists at first is a simple `pages/` and `public/` directory. Go ahead and set up your folder structure so it looks like this:

```
components/
pages/
  post/
posts/
public/
  static/
```

This is how it should look in your editor all together:

![Next.js blog project folder structure example](https://cdn.netlify.com/34cb692e1d3233a2f380b059ad0f71cd7d1784da/975d9/img/blog/screen-shot-2020-05-04-at-9.40.57-am.png)

## Let’s code!

Now that we have everything set up, go and replace everything in your `index.js` with this:

```jsx
const Index = ({ title, description, ...props }) => {
  return <div>Hello, world!</div>;
};

export default Index;

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const configData = await import(`../siteconfig.json`);

  return {
    props: {
      title: configData.default.title,
      description: configData.default.description,
    },
  };
}
```

If you’d like, at this point you can stick your own custom favicon in the `public` folder and replace the one that came with the code. I have a little Netlify logo as one, so I’ll use that. If you're not sure how to do this, I personally use this [Favicon & App Icon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) site.

In your terminal, run `npm run dev`, and voila! You have a Next app up and running!

![Hello, World Next.js site on localhost, in the browser](https://cdn.netlify.com/9ef8dff964256371a83aac9e10b7d8263497de72/5818d/img/blog/18c61719-61ca-4746-b671-9ee7a9c62537.png)

Chances are if you know React, this `index.js` file isn’t too surprising. I’d like to explain that `getStaticProps` function for you, though. It was released in Next 9.3. That function lets you fetch data, and return it as props to the page component. You can use `getStaticProps` to fetch local data (as you can see here, fetching from the `siteconfig.json` file), or external APIs and libraries. This function will only work on page components in the `pages` directory! The page will be rendered at build time, and you can pass that data to its child components. Let’s implement some of those child components now, so you can see it work in action.

## Components!

Now, we want to get some real routing and components showing up here. Let’s start with components, and make three JS files inside our `components` folder, called `Header.js`, `Layout.js`, and `PostList.js`.

- The `Header.js` file will contain our site header and navigation.
- The `PostList.js` file will, as you can guess, list our blog posts.
- The `Layout.js` file is the juicy one. It’s going to pull in our Header, populate the `<head>` HTML tag, contain all content that the site holds, and throw a footer in there as well.

Let’s implement `Layout.js` first, and get it on our homepage. Open up `Layout.js` and put this in there:

```jsx
import Head from "next/head";
import Header from "./Header";

export default function Layout({ children, pageTitle, ...props }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <title>{pageTitle}</title>
      </Head>
      <section className="layout">
        <div className="content">{children}</div>
      </section>
      <footer>Built by me!</footer>
    </>
  );
}
```

Notice the `Head` component from `next/head` here. In Next, whenever you want to include tags in the `<head>` of your rendered HTML page, you use this element! I only included one `<meta>` tag and the `<title>` in this example, but you can populate it to your heart’s content.

The rest of the file is just rendering some basic blocks for our layout. Now, let’s head over to `index.js` and replace our “hello world” `<div>` with this:

```diff-jsx

const Index = ({ title, description, ...props }) => {
+  return (
+    <Layout pageTitle={title}>
+      <h1 className="title">Welcome to my blog!</h1>
+      <p className="description">
+        {description}
+      </p>
+      <main>
+        Posts go here!
+      </main>
+    </Layout>)
}
```

And make sure to import the `Layout` component at the top of index.js as well:

```jsx
import Layout from "../components/Layout";
```

Alright, let’s check out our site in the browser!

![Next.js blog page shown locally with our title, description, and footer.](https://cdn.netlify.com/484497b736c86602027502624b5536b0dcc885c6/6879d/img/blog/ef26f382-dcc1-4f8b-bb10-8418b7f55e8e.png)

Not too shabby! Notice how the description in the paragraph there and the title on the browser tab comes from our `getStaticProps`. We’re using real data!

Let’s add in a `Header` component now. Open up `Header.js` and add this in there:

```jsx
import Link from "next/link";

export default function Header() {
  return (
    <>
      <header className="header">
        <nav className="nav">
          <Link href="/">
            <a>My Blog</a>
          </Link>
          <Link href="/about">
            <a>About</a>
          </Link>
        </nav>
      </header>
    </>
  );
}
```

Alright, let’s take this apart a bit. Notice the usage of the `Link` tag. Client-side transitions between your routes are enabled with this. There’s a pretty nice API built in there (check it out [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link)), but the 2 things that you need to know for this example is that `href` is the only required prop (and it points to a path from inside the `pages` directory, and you have to put an `<a>` component in there to build the links properly for your site’s SEO.

Okie dokie, now that we’ve made this component, let’s pull it into our `Layout` component. Plop a `<Header />` tag right at the top of the `<section>` tag we have in there. We already imported the `Header` component earlier, so that should be all you need to do to make it load!

```diff-jsx
export default function Layout({ children, pageTitle, ...props }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <title>{pageTitle}</title>
      </Head>
      <section className="layout">
+        <Header />
        <div className="content">{children}</div>
      </section>
      <footer>Built by me!</footer>
    </>
  )
}
```

Let’s check it out in the browser.

![Next.js blog showing navigation links on top of the existing blog](https://cdn.netlify.com/d51312c64bb8529ebf51bb39f8a36d3b9161e297/5c2b8/img/blog/1ed1c077-5d1f-4c43-8313-27ee2713f5e8.png)

Oh heck. We have navigation, people! You might notice though that if you click on that About link, we get a 404. We should fix that.

### Adding more page components

Okay, so now that we have navigation going, we’re going to need to be able to have things to navigate to (especially once we have posts going).

Create an `about.js` file in the `pages` folder, and fill it with something like this:

```jsx
import Layout from "../components/Layout";

const About = ({ title, description, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <Layout pageTitle={`${title} | About`} description={description}>
        <h1 className="title">Welcome to my blog!</h1>

        <p className="description">{description}</p>

        <p>
          I am a very exciting person. I know this because I'm following a very
          exciting tutorial, and a not-exciting person wouldn't do that.
        </p>
      </Layout>
    </>
  );
};

export default About;

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const configData = await import(`../siteconfig.json`);

  return {
    props: {
      title: configData.default.title,
      description: configData.default.description,
    },
  };
}
```

This looks a lot like our `index.js` file, and that’s cool for now. You can populate it with whatever, and you can even add more files in here if you want. But, for now, let’s just go back to our browser and click on the About link in the navigation.

![Next.js site About page with the given content in it](https://cdn.netlify.com/5a66b3a81e0ca2f17a76bd66003fe639c4ab305c/c4467/img/blog/52f69c0a-d515-45c2-8248-49e1bfe1dfcf.png)

Oh me oh my, we have pages! Are you thrilled? I’m thrilled. Let’s get more thrilled and talk about **dynamic routes**.

## Dynamic Routes

So, right now, when you want to navigate between pages, we know that we just have to make a file for it, and the route exists. If we made an `ilovenetlify.js` file in the `pages` directory, we could go to `localhost:3000/ilovenetlify` and it would just work. But what about when we have blog posts that have dynamic titles, and we want to name our routes after those titles? Well, don’t fret, Next has a solution for you.

Go ahead and make a file in `pages/post` called `[postname].js`, Oh gee, there’s square brackets in the file name! That’s how Next knows that you have a dynamic route. The file path `pages/post/[postname].js` will end up being `localhost:3000/post/:postname` in the browser! That’s right, we have both a nested route, and a dynamic route here. Someone call the web development police, we’re onto something!

## Processing Markdown

Before we populate `[postname].js`, we have to install a few other things into our project.

```shell
npm install react-markdown gray-matter raw-loader
```

- React Markdown is a library that will parse and render Markdown files.
- Gray Matter will parse the YAML “front matter” of our blog posts (the parts of our Markdown posts with the metadata we’ll need).
- Raw Loader is a loader that will allow us to import our Markdown files with webpack.

Now, make a `next.config.js` file at the top level, and populate it with this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  target: "serverless",
  webpack: function (config) {
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.md$/,
      use: "raw-loader",
    });
    return config;
  },
};
```

**Note:** You will probably have to restart your dev server after adding this file!

Still with me? Now that we have these libraries set up, we can actually set up our `[postname].js` to use it all. Stick this in the file:

```jsx
import Link from "next/link";
import matter from "gray-matter";
import ReactMarkdown from "react-markdown";

import Layout from "../../components/Layout";

export default function BlogPost({ siteTitle, frontmatter, markdownBody }) {
  if (!frontmatter) return <></>;

  return (
    <Layout pageTitle={`${siteTitle} | ${frontmatter.title}`}>
      <Link href="/">
        <a>Back to post list</a>
      </Link>
      <article>
        <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
        <p>By {frontmatter.author}</p>
        <div>
          <ReactMarkdown source={markdownBody} />
        </div>
      </article>
    </Layout>
  );
}

export async function getStaticProps({ ...ctx }) {
  const { postname } = ctx.params;

  const content = await import(`../../posts/${postname}.md`);
  const config = await import(`../../siteconfig.json`);
  const data = matter(content.default);

  return {
    props: {
      siteTitle: config.title,
      frontmatter: data.data,
      markdownBody: data.content,
    },
  };
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const blogSlugs = ((context) => {
    const keys = context.keys();
    const data = keys.map((key, index) => {
      let slug = key.replace(/^.*[\\\/]/, "").slice(0, -3);

      return slug;
    });
    return data;
  })(require.context("../../posts", true, /\.md$/));

  const paths = blogSlugs.map((slug) => `/post/${slug}`);

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
}
```

Whew, this is a long one, so let’s break it down.

- In `getStaticProps`, we pull in the Markdown files that are in the `posts` directory. We also get our `siteconfig.json` again, to get the site’s title for the browser tab. We use Gray Matter to parse the front matter in our blog posts. We then return all of this to be props for the component.
- We also have a `getStaticPaths`, which was also new in Next 9.3. This function defines a list of paths that have to be rendered to HTML at build time. So, what we do here is take in all of our Markdown files in the `posts` directory, parse out the file names, define a list of slugs based on each file name, and return them. We also return a `fallback` which is false, so that 404 pages appear if something’s not matching properly.
- In the `BlogPost` component itself, we use the values given to us in `getStaticProps` to populate a `Layout` component with our blog post content.

Alrighty! We have done a lot of work without seeing a lot of results yet. Let’s change that. Make a `mypost.md` file in the `posts/` directory at the top level, and populate it with something that looks like this:

```markdown
---
title: "Hello, world!"
author: "Cassidy"
---

Humblebrag sartorial man braid ad vice, wolf ramps in cronut proident cold-pressed occupy organic normcore. Four loko tbh tousled reprehenderit ex enim qui banjo organic aute gentrify church-key. Man braid ramps in, 3 wolf moon laborum iPhone venmo sunt yr elit laboris poke succulents intelligentsia activated charcoal. Gentrify messenger bag hot chicken brooklyn. Seitan four loko art party, ut 8-bit live-edge heirloom. Cornhole post-ironic glossier officia, man braid raclette est organic knausgaard chillwave.

- Look at me
- I am in a list
- Woo hoo
```

I used [Hipster Ipsum](https://hipsum.co/) for this, but you can fill it with whatever. In the front matter at the top, we only have a title and author because that’s all we use in our `BlogPost` component. You can add whatever you want in here (like a date, for example), as long as you use it in the component.

We’ve done it! Navigate to `localhost:3000/post/mypost` and witness all of your hard work!

![Next.js blog on localhost showing contents of the blog post markdown rendered to the page.](https://cdn.netlify.com/2d44be433dc9ec980ea2f836b83f9990fabb5bbc/a02cd/img/blog/a7f9014b-ee43-40f1-94b7-63872679e796.png)

## Listing our posts

Now that we are able to make Markdown blog posts with dynamic routes, we should try to list all of the blog posts that we make on our blog’s homepage. Good thing we already made `PostList.js` earlier in our `components/` directory! Write this code into that file:

```jsx
import Link from "next/link";

export default function PostList({ posts }) {
  if (posts === "undefined") return null;

  return (
    <div>
      {!posts && <div>No posts!</div>}
      <ul>
        {posts &&
          posts.map((post) => {
            return (
              <li key={post.slug}>
                <Link href={{ pathname: `/post/${post.slug}` }}>
                  <a>{post.frontmatter.title}</a>
                </Link>
              </li>
            );
          })}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now, notice how we want to use post data that’s passed in as a prop. We’ll have to do this from `index.js`. Head back over there, and put `<PostList />` in the `<main>` tag, and import it at the top like so:

```diff-jsx
+ import PostList from '../components/PostList'

const Index = ({ posts, title, description, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <Layout pageTitle={title}>
      <h1 className="title">Welcome to my blog!</h1>
      <p className="description">{description}</p>
      <main>
+        <PostList />
      </main>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

What do we do when we want to get external data, say for example, our post data? We use `getStaticProps`! Scroll down there and modify the function to look like this:

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const configData = await import(`../siteconfig.json`);

  const posts = ((context) => {
    const keys = context.keys();
    const values = keys.map(context);

    const data = keys.map((key, index) => {
      let slug = key.replace(/^.*[\\\/]/, "").slice(0, -3);
      const value = values[index];
      const document = matter(value.default);
      return {
        frontmatter: document.data,
        markdownBody: document.content,
        slug,
      };
    });
    return data;
  })(require.context("../posts", true, /\.md$/));

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
      title: configData.default.title,
      description: configData.default.description,
    },
  };
}
```

We added a `posts` variable in here that pulls in the Markdown files, parses them (like we did before), and then passes that `posts` variable into the props for `Index`. Now the rest of your `index.js` file should look like this:

```jsx
import matter from "gray-matter";

import Layout from "../components/Layout";
import PostList from "../components/PostList";

const Index = ({ posts, title, description, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <Layout pageTitle={title}>
      <h1 className="title">Welcome to my blog!</h1>
      <p className="description">{description}</p>
      <main>
        <PostList posts={posts} />
      </main>
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default Index;
```

We imported `matter` to parse the front matter, we passed in `posts` as a prop, and then drilled that down into `PostList` so that we can get a list of real posts. Let’s look at our browser!

![Next.js project showing list of blog posts on our homepage](https://cdn.netlify.com/25f99969a62497b8632467642e3ab69d481b06ac/12bfc/img/blog/82a98c83-ca79-47d6-bde9-7e6bc6b806da.png)

Hooray!! We have a post list!! Now, whenever we add a Markdown file to our `posts` directory, it will appear here in the listing.

## Optional customization

I won’t get into styling right now, but if you’d like to see the [final demo](https://github.com/cassidoo/next-netlify-blog-starter) with it built in, go ahead! Next 9.4 supports styled-jsx, Sass, CSS Modules, and more out of the box, so you can use whatever you prefer.

In Next 9.4, they released the ability to add absolute imports to your code (I talk more about that in [this blog post](https://url.netlify.com/rJpH3US28)). If you'd like to clean up your imports (nobody likes writing all of that `../../etc`), you can add a `jsconfig.json` to the top level of your project that looks like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "paths": {
      "@components/*": ["components/*"],
      "@utils/*": ["utils/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now with this, whenever you want to access your components, you can type `@components/something` instead of `../../components/something`. Check out the demo project to see it in action!

## Deploying to Netlify

We have been on QUITE the journey, folks. Let’s get our blog online for the world to see. Make a file at the top level of your directory called `netlify.toml`, and fill it with this:

```yaml
[build]
  command = "npm run build && npm run export"
  publish = "out"
```

The `command` here is referring to the "Build Command" that Netlify will use to build and bundle up your final site. The `publish` is referring to the directory in which the build will be located after bundling! Next.js always exports to the `out` directory unless you configure it otherwise.

Then, open up your `package.json` and add this to the `scripts` underneath `"start"`:

```json
"export": "next export"
```

Amazingly, this is all you need to get your project set up for Netlify! Push your code to a repository on your favorite platform.

Now, log in to Netlify, and click “New site from Git” and follow the prompts to select your repo. Because you have your `netlify.toml` file already made, the build settings should already be filled out for you:

!["Create a new site" on Netlify](https://cdn.netlify.com/ee37318ca78895f6748b3757026cdd6e2cc840de/38d20/img/blog/10e549df-2c88-4762-9a9f-ba7c3e560914.png)

Click that shiny “Deploy site” button, and within a few moments your site is live!! You did it!! And, whenever you make changes to your project and push them to your GitHub repo, your site will rebuild automatically. How cool is that??

Once again, if you want to see the final version I put together (with styles included), you can [check it out here](https://github.com/cassidoo/next-netlify-blog-starter), or deploy it directly with a single click!

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/cassidoo/next-netlify-blog-starter&utm_source=github&utm_medium=blogstarter-cs&utm_campaign=devex)

## You did it!

Congratulations. It was a long journey, but you’ve made a Next 9.4-powered, Markdown blog, complete with dynamic routing and the latest and greatest functions in Next to build an optimized static site. And, of course, you deployed it to Netlify, and it’ll keep updating as long as you keep updating it.

I’m proud of you, and I hope you learned something today! If you ever have questions, head over to our [Community](https://community.netlify.com/) and we’ll get you sorted!
