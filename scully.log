We encountered a problem while reading the routes from your applications source.
This might happen when there are lazy-loaded routes, that are not loaded,
Or when there are paths we can not resolve statically.
Check the routes in your app, rebuild and retry.
[33m(You can inspect the error by passing the --showGuessError flag[39m

[32mWhen there are extraRoutes in your config, we will still try to render those.[39m
